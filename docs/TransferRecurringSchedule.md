# TransferRecurringSchedule

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**interval_unit** | [**models::TransferScheduleIntervalUnit**](TransferScheduleIntervalUnit.md) |  | 
**interval_count** | **i32** | The number of recurring `interval_units` between originations. The recurring interval (before holiday adjustment) is calculated by multiplying `interval_unit` and `interval_count`. For example, to schedule a recurring transfer which originates once every two weeks, set `interval_unit` = `week` and `interval_count` = 2. | 
**interval_execution_day** | **i32** | The day of the interval on which to schedule the transfer.  If the `interval_unit` is `week`, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer from 1 (Monday) to 5 (Friday).  If the `interval_unit` is `month`, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer indicating which day of the month to make the transfer on. Integers from 1 to 28 can be used to make a transfer on that day of the month. Negative integers from -1 to -5 can be used to make a transfer relative to the end of the month. To make a transfer on the last day of the month, use -1; to make the transfer on the second-to-last day, use -2, and so on.  The transfer will be originated on the next available banking day if the designated day is a non banking day. | 
**start_date** | **chrono::NaiveDate** | A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). The recurring transfer will begin on the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the `start_date`.  For `rtp` recurring transfers, `start_date` must be in the future. Otherwise, if the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the start date is also the same day that `/transfer/recurring/create` was called, the bank *may* make the first payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so. | 
**end_date** | Option<**chrono::NaiveDate**> | A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). The recurring transfer will end on the last `interval_execution_day` on or before the `end_date`. If the `interval_execution_day` between the start date and the end date (inclusive) is also the same day that `/transfer/recurring/create` was called, the bank *may* make a payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so. | [optional]
