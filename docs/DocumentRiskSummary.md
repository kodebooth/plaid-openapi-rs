# DocumentRiskSummary

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**risk_score** | Option<**f64**> | A number between 0 and 100, inclusive, where a score closer to 0 indicates a document is likely to be trustworthy and a score closer to 100 indicates a document is likely to be fraudulent. You can automatically reject documents with a high risk score, automatically accept documents with a low risk score, and manually review documents in between. We suggest starting with a threshold of 80 for auto-rejection and 20 for auto-acceptance. As you gather more data points on typical risk scores for your use case, you can tune these parameters to reduce the number of documents undergoing manual review. |
